# TF2CDownloader
Official tool for handling installation, updating, and more for TF2 Classic.

Requires Rich, PyZstd, and TQDM. On Linux, we recommend using Apt to install the python3-tqdm and python3-rich packages. Install PyZstd through PIP.

PyInstaller is used to build this into a single-file binary. Buildscripts are included.

In the Binaries folder of the repository, Aria2 is extracted from: https://github.com/q3aql/aria2-static-builds (aria2-1.36.0-win-64bit-build2.7z)

aria2c.exe can be replaced with your own build as desired.
